Certainly! Here's the README file updated to reflect the MERN stack:

Task Management Application (MERN Stack)
Overview
This project is a simple task management application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, organized by status. The application provides a user-friendly interface and responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.

Technologies Used
Frontend: React.js, CSS/SASS
Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
Database: MongoDB Atlas (Cloud-hosted MongoDB)
Testing: Jest, Supertest
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-management-app.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd task-management-app
Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:
Frontend: cd frontend && npm install
Backend: cd backend && npm install
Start the backend server: cd backend && npm start
Start the frontend development server: cd frontend && npm start
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

API Documentation
The backend provides the following API endpoints:

GET /api/tasks: Retrieve all tasks
POST /api/tasks: Create a new task
PUT /api/tasks/:taskId: Update an existing task
DELETE /api/tasks/:taskId: Delete a task
Database Schema
The MongoDB database stores tasks with the following schema:

Copy code
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  status: String // Possible values: "To Do", "In Progress", "Done"
}
Assumptions and Considerations
Assumption: Only authenticated users can access the application.
Design Decision: Chose MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted database for scalability and reliability.
Trade-off: Sacrificed relational database features for flexibility and scalability.
Testing Instructions
Backend: Run cd backend && npm test
Frontend: Run cd frontend && npm test
Security Measures
Firebase authentication ensures only authenticated users can access the application.
Input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
Limited database access rights to prevent unauthorized access.
Deployment Instructions
Set up a hosting service (e.g., Heroku for backend, Netlify for frontend).
Configure environment variables for production (e.g., database connection string, API keys).
Deploy the backend and frontend to their respective hosting platforms.
Additional Notes
Performance Optimization: Lazy loading of components to improve initial load time.
Future Enhancements: Implementing task due dates and reminders, user profiles with avatars, and search functionality.
